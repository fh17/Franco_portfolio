# Franco_portfolio

My name is Franco Harte, I'm 25 and I've sudied data science at Nucleo Digital School.

So far, I finished my bachelor degree of mechanical engineering in the University of Rosario (Argenrtina) in 2021, come abroad that same year to Belgium to play profesional Field Hockey (what I still do) and at the same time study data science. Thanks to my degree I've been able to acquire knowledge in general science, statistics working with programmes such as Matlab and SolidWorks studio.

In this Github profile it will be posted different projects of Data science where my skills will be shown.
